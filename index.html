  <h1>Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost</h1>

  <h2>1. Data and Goal</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, I use time series data from a Kaggle dataset:
    <strong>[INSERT DATASET NAME HERE]</strong>.
    The target variable I want to forecast is
    <strong>[INSERT TARGET, e.g. daily sales, energy demand, etc.]</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forecasting this series is important because
    <strong>[EXPLAIN WHY: e.g. it helps plan inventory, staffing, budgeting, etc.]</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Train/Test Split</h2>
  <p>
    I sorted the data by date and used the first
    <strong>[PERCENT OR DATE RANGE]</strong> as training data and the last
    <strong>[PERCENT OR DATE RANGE]</strong> as test data. This simulates
    predicting future values using only past information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trade-off: more training data can improve learning but leaves less data to
    evaluate performance; more test data gives a better evaluation but less
    training for the model.

  <h2>3. Features for the Model</h2>
  <p>
    From the original date column, I created several derived variables, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Month of the year (to capture seasonality).</li>
    <li>Day of the week (to capture weekly patterns).</li>
    <li>Weekend vs weekday.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I also included lag features, such as the value 1 step ago (lag 1),
    2 steps ago (lag 2), etc. These lags let the model use recent history to
    predict future values.
  </p>

  <h2>4. XGBoost Ensemble Model</h2>
  <p>
    I used an ensemble tree method (XGBoost Regressor). XGBoost builds many
    decision trees sequentially, where each tree tries to correct the errors
    of the previous trees. This allows it to capture nonlinear patterns and
    interactions between features.
  </p>
  <p>
    I trained XGBoost on the training portion of the data and evaluated it
    on the test portion using metrics such as MAE (mean absolute error) and
    RMSE (root mean squared error).

  <p>
    Test results (example numbers, you will replace these):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>MAE: [YOUR VALUE]</li>
    <li>RMSE: [YOUR VALUE]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Alternative Model and Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    I also fit an alternative time series model:
    <strong>[ARIMA / Prophet / KNN / etc.]</strong>.
    I trained it on the same training data and evaluated it on the same test data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example comparison (you will fill this in with your actual results):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>XGBoost RMSE: [YOUR VALUE]</li>
    <li>Alternative model RMSE: [YOUR VALUE]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Brief conclusion: which model did better and why do you think that is?
  </p>

  <h2>6. Forecasting into the Future</h2>
  <p>
    After validating performance on the test data, I used the XGBoost model
    to predict future values for
    <strong>[NUMBER OF STEPS, e.g. 30 days]</strong>. I generated these
    forecasts step-by-step, using each new prediction as input for the next
    time step via the lag features.

  <h2>7. Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project shows how tree-based ensemble models and basic time series
    techniques (train/test split, date features, lag features) can be combined
    to produce useful forecasts. Time series forecasting is important because
    it turns historical data into information about the future, which helps
    organizations plan and make better decisions.
